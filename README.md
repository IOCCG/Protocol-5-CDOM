This repository contains a version of the published IOCCG Protocols for reference and for community discussion, and Q&A through the "Discussions" feature, and direct improvements to the protocol content through the "Issues" feature. These engagements are meant to be open and accessible to all interested in using the protocol, and will help the community to better implement the protocols, as well as advance improvements and updates to the protocol versions through community discussion. See the DOI or the [IOCCG website](https://ioccg.org/what-we-do/ioccg-publications/ioccg-protocols/) for the published version (in PDF).
